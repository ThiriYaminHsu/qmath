### Accuracy notebooks

In this folder we put notebooks demonstrating accuracy of algorithms.

Really these should be unit tests, but they would run so long that it would be 
impractical to run them as tests. So we run accuracy computations once and put 
them here as notebooks.

These notebooks are not intended for comparison/analysis. These demonstrate that
algorithms are implemented corrctly to high precision.
